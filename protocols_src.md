The protocol repository is [here](https://github.com/proof-ladders/protocol-ladder). The problem set is presented in a [pdf file](https://github.com/proof-ladders/protocol-ladder/blob/main/Notes/main.pdf), we recommend to start the reading.

If you are familiar with formal methods, the [README of the protocol repository](https://github.com/proof-ladders/protocol-ladder) gives you the keys to navigate the set of proposed solutions. If you are not, we give below an introductory step-by-step tutorial to the analysis of one of the problems, with key insights into its modeling using CryptoVerif [@cryptoverif], EasyCrypt [@easycrypt], ProVerif [@proverif], Tamarin [@tamarin] and Squirrel [@squirrel].
