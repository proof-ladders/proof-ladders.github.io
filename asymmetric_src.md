The repository of public key proofs is
[here](https://github.com/proof-ladders/asymmetric-ladder). The problem set is
presented in a [pdf
file](https://github.com/proof-ladders/asymmetric-ladder/blob/main/asymmetric-problems.pdf);
we recommend you start reading the PDF then come back here.

The rest of this page is dedicated to a high-level description of a generic
construction of Public Key Encryption (PKE) from a Key Encapsulation Mechanism
(KEM) and a Data Encryption Mechanism (DEM); and of a result bounding its
insecurity against Chosen Plaintext Attacks. We also give some insights into
modelling the construction and the proof in a few formal verification tools.
(Currently planned: ProofFrog [@prooffrog] and EasyCrypt [@easycrypt].)
