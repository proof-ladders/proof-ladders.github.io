# Updating the website

Please do not edit HTML directly! Edit corresponding markdown files instead,
then run make, and push your modifications to github.

If you have trouble compiling, markdown changes can be pushed inside a pull request that others can compile and merge.

# Requirements

## Pandoc

You need the --citeproc option, which means version 2.19.2 or above.

You may need to install it directly from pandoc's website,
which provides e.g. Debian packets for the latest pandoc.
